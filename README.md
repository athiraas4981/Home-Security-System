# Home-Security-System

ABSTRACT

The system is about remotely managed door accessibility and voice altering through smart phone and receive captured image of visitor at door bell system has indispensable in daily life. The design and development of a smart security system, based on face recognition, pre-image processing human motion detection and remotely monitoring technology.
This project describes about the Implementation and deployment of wireless control system and accessibility into a home environment. A PIR motion sensor and camera module are used to detect motion and face recognition respectively on the basis of deep learning. Electromagnetic door lock module operate the door accessibility. 
The proposed system uses controller interface system with Raspberry Pi which is low cost and consume smaller amount of power. When visitor motion detected at Door, Camera module interfaced to Raspberry Pi capture images, save it on system. When a visitor is at the door the user is notify via an app and user can authorized the visitor entry in the house. The concerned authority can control the system and view video stream of camera module through Smart mobile Phone. The system also provided concerned authority to use Smart Phone to send command for voice alert when intruder identified.
